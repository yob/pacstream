A small library to assist with sending and receiving electronic ordering
data with PACSTREAM.

Getting the order formats right is left to the user, this is just a 
wrapper around Net::FTP that puts files the right spot, etc.

I am not connected in any way with the owners of the PACSTREAM service,
The ECN Group. I just work for a company that uses PACSTREAM to send and
receive orders with other companies.

The PACSTREAM brand is Â© 2007 The ECN Group
